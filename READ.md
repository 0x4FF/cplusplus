**Analyze** 
```cpp
#include <iostream>
int main()
{
std::cout << "Hello World!" << std::endl;
```

So when we look at this code the first line we see is `#include <iostream>`. This is a preprocessor directive that includes the content of the standard C++ header file, what is a "preprocessor" you might ask?.

*Preprocessor*

The preprocessor is a program that processes its input data to produce output that is used as input to another program, it is apart of the compilation process, while writing code you can include preprocessor directives like; `#include <iostream>`. `<iostream>` is a header file including instructions to later be used in the source code
